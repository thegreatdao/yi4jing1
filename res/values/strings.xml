	    The I Ching (Wade-Giles), "Yì Jīng" (Pinyin), also known as the Book of Changes, 
		Classic of Changes; and Zhouyi, is one of the oldest of the Chinese classic texts.
		The book contains a divination system comparable to Western geomancy or the West African 
		Ifá system. In Western cultures and modern East Asia, it is still widely used for this purpose.
